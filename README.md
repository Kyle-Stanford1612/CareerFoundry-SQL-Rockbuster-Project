# SQL - Rockbuster Video Rental Project
This repository contains my SQL code for a student project I completed whilst studying at CareerFoundry. This project culminated in the creation of a data dictionary, documented queries to be shared with other analysts, and a data-driven presentation which answered business questions.

## Project Context:
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.

## Key Questions and Objectives:
The Rockbuster Stealth Management Board has asked a series of business questions and they expect data-driven answers that they can use for their 2020 company strategy. These are the main questions they’d like to answer:

● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?

● What was the average rental duration for all videos?

● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?

● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?

● Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

## Data and Tools Used:
Rockbuster's relational database management system was queried using **PostgreSQL** to answer business questions.

The following Entity Relationship Diagram shows the layout of Rockbuster's database, including tables for customers, payments, rentals, films, film inventory, staff, and more:
