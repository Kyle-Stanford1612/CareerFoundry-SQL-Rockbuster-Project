Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that uses stores around the world. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.

I’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s (BI) department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service.
